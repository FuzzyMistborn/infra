# Kelsier Notes

Things I can't ansible but want to remember:
- Need to first install `openssh` and configure basic step
- Install zsh4humans: `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romkatv/zsh4humans/v5/install)"`
    - Handles installing zsh and the basic plugins.  Can't automate it.
