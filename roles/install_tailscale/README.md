# Tailscale Installer

An ansible role to install and configure Tailscale on *Ubuntu*-based systems.

If you want to install on other systems, see [this one](https://github.com/artis3n/ansible-role-tailscale) by @artis3n.  I stripped this one down as I only needed Tailscale on Ubuntu and nothing beyond that.
